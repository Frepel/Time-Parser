The TimeParser
==============


This small script takes a time in the followin format hh:mm", "hh.mm", 
"hh,mm" or "hh" and returns it as "hh:mm". If the hours or minutes are 
inserted in incorrectly the script asks the user to reinsert the time or quit.

1.Start the "applicatoin" by typing ./timeparser.py (remember to give it
execution rights chmod +x timeparser.py)
2.Insert the time
3 Enjoy the correct output
